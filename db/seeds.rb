He joined Gap Inc. in 2005 and has held senior leadership positions across nearly every area of the company.From 2012 to January 2015, Art served as President of the company’s Growth, Innovation and Digital (GID) division, with responsibility for the digital strategy of our more than $2 billion e-commerce business across the 80 countries where the company serves customers online. He drove the innovation agenda for the company across its digital platforms and more than 3,000 stores around the world. Ultimately, Art and his team developed and deployed the industry-leading, omni-channel platform for consumers to bridge the physical and digital shopping experience.
In this broad operating role, Art guided the growth of the emerging brands Athleta, Piperlime and Intermix, which is particularly fitting given he led the internal efforts to acquire Athleta, in 2008, and Intermix, in 2012. Art also added responsibility for the Gap Inc. technology division, working closely with the company’s chief information officer to optimize innovative and business solutions.

In his prior role, Art served as president of Gap North America, with its fleet of more than 700 stores, from February 2011 to November 2012. A product resurgence during this period drew customers back to the company’s namesake brand and helped improve the division’s sales performance for six consecutive quarters during his tenure and thereafter.

Previously, from 2008 to 2011, Art led the Outlet division, delivering strong sales and earnings growth for the value expressions of Gap and Banana Republic. Among the strategic shifts during this time, the division expanded globally, including first-ever Outlet store openings in Canada and Europe.
Art joined the company as executive vice president of Strategy & Operations, and he made an immediate impact by launching the company’s first franchise business, which now has grown to about 400 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy franchise stores in 40 countries. It was during this time that Art and CEO Glenn Murphy worked together to orchestrate the company’s China entry and architect the company’s current global growth strategy.

A champion of the company values to “do more than sell clothes,” Art has been a trustee on the board of Gap Foundation since 2008, and a long-time advocate for corporate social responsibility and the company’s philanthropic work. He played an integral role in Gap’s partnership with Product (RED) in 2006, in which a portion of product sales went to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in Africa, and was a key supporter of the company’s decision in February 2014 to raise its minimum wage for U.S. employees.")
